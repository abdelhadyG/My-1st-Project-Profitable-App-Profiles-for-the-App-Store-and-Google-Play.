# My-1st-Project-Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play.
My aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. My job - as a data analyst - is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.  Only apps that are free to download and install, the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. My goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
